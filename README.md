📊 Customer Behaviour Analysis

End-to-end data analytics project demonstrating data cleaning, SQL-based business analysis, dashboard development, and reporting.

📌 Overview

This project analyses customer purchasing behaviour using a structured data analytics workflow.

The objective is to extract actionable business insights from raw transactional data by applying Python for data preparation, SQL for structured querying, and Power BI for interactive visualisation.

The project covers the complete analytics lifecycle:

Data Loading → Data Cleaning → Exploratory Data Analysis → SQL Business Queries → Dashboard Creation → Report & Presentation

🗂 Dataset

Structured transactional dataset

Customer demographics, product details, and purchase behaviour

Includes variables such as:

Age, Gender, Location

Category, Purchase Amount

Subscription Status

Previous Purchases

Review Rating

Shipping Type

The dataset was analysed to identify revenue drivers, customer segments, and purchasing patterns.
